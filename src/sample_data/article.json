French President Emmanuel Macron echoed Merz’s assessment and said that Europe’s old security structures tied to the previous world order don't exist and that Europe must prepare for war. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that we are in a “new geopolitics era” because the “old world” is gone.",

How Stage 6 works is explained in detail in Chapter 6, “The Big Cycle of External Order and Disorder,” in my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order. While I previously shared a lengthy set of excerpts from Chapter 5 (\"The Big Cycle of Internal Order and Disorder\"), so you could see how what is going on with the United States tracks the classic cycle explained in that chapter, I am including all of Chapter 6 here for your review.  Given the now nearly universal agreement that the post-1945 world order has broken down and that we are entering a new world order, I think it would be worth your time to read.",

In fact, it wasn’t long ago that there were no distinctions between internal and external orders because there were no clearly defined and mutually recognized boundaries between countries. For that reason, the six-stage cycle of going between order and disorder that I described in the last chapter about what happens within countries works the same way between countries, with one big exception: international relations are driven much more by raw power dynamics. That is because all governance systems require effective and agreed-upon 1) laws and law-making abilities, 2) law enforcement capabilities (e.g., police), 3) ways of adjudicating (e.g., judges), and 4) clear and specified consequences that both suit crimes and are enforced (e.g., fines and incarcerations), and those things either don’t exist or are not as effective in guiding relations between countries as they are in guiding relations within them.",

Both the upswings (the periods of peace and prosperity) and the downswings (the periods of depression and war) affected the whole world. Not all countries prosper when the leading powers do because countries gain at the expense of others. For example, the decline of China from around 1840 to 1949, known as the “Century of Humiliation,” came about because the Western powers and Japan exploited China.",

To be clear, while I believe most are tragic and fought for nonsensical reasons, some are worth fighting because the consequences of not fighting them (e.g., the loss of freedom) would be intolerable.",

Because wealth equals power in terms of the ability to build military strength, control trade, and influence other nations,  domestic and military strength go hand in hand. It takes money to buy guns (military power) and it takes money to buy butter (domestic social spending needs). When a country fails to provide adequate amounts of either, it becomes vulnerable to domestic and foreign opposition. From my study of Chinese dynasties and European empires, I’ve learned that  the financial strength to outspend one’s rivals is one of the most important strengths a country can have. That is how the United States beat the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Spend enough money in the right ways, and you don’t have to have a shooting war. Long-term success depends on sustaining both the “guns” and the “butter” without producing the excesses that lead to their declines. In other words, a country must be strong enough financially to give its people both a good living standard and protection from outside enemies. The really successful countries have been able to do that for 200 to 300 years. None has been able to do it forever.",

Having power is good because power will win out over agreements, rules, and laws all the time. When push comes to shove, those who have the power to either enforce their interpretation of the rules and laws or to overturn them will get what they want. It is important to respect power because it’s not smart to fight a war that one is going to lose; it is preferable to negotiate the best settlement possible (that is unless one wants to be a martyr, which is usually for stupid ego reasons rather than for sensible strategic reasons). It is also important to use power wisely. Using power wisely doesn’t necessarily mean forcing others to give you what you want—i.e., bullying them. It includes the recognition that generosity and trust are powerful forces for producing win-win relationships, which are fabulously more rewarding than lose-lose relationships. In other words, it is often the case that using one’s “hard powers” is not the best path and that using one’s “soft powers” is preferable.",

But there are times when showing one’s power and threatening to use it are most effective for improving one’s negotiating position and preventing a fight.

While the stories from this period are very interesting in and of themselves, they are especially important because they provide lessons that help us think about what is happening now and what might be ahead. Most importantly, the United States and China are in an economic war that could conceivably evolve into a military war and comparisons between the 1930s and today provide valuable insights into what might happen and how to avoid a terrible war.",

In Germany, Japan, Italy, and Spain, extremely bad economic circumstances and less well-established democratic traditions led to extreme internal conflicts and a turn to populist/autocratic leaders of the right (i.e., fascists), just as at different points in time the Soviet Union and China, which also endured extreme circumstances and had no experience with democracy, turned to populist/autocratic leaders of the left (i.e., communists). The US and the UK had much stronger democratic traditions and less severe economic conditions, so they became more populist and autocratic than they had been, but not nearly as much as other nations.",

But the global depression hit Germany hard, leading to nearly 25 percent unemployment, massive bankruptcies, and extensive poverty. As is typical, there was a struggle between populists of the left (communists) and populists of the right (fascists). Adolf Hitler, the leading populist/fascist, tapped into the mood of national humiliation to build a nationalistic furor, casting the Treaty of Versailles and the countries that imposed it as the enemy. He created a 25-point nationalistic program and rallied support around it. In response to internal fighting and the desire to restore order, Hitler was appointed chancellor in January 1933, drawing large support for his Nazi Party from industrialists who feared the communists. Two months later, the Nazi Party won the most support and the most seats in the German Parliament (the Reichstag).",

He invoked Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution to put an end to many civil rights and suppress political opposition from the communists, and forced the passage of the Enabling Act, which allowed him to pass laws without the approval of the Reichstag and the president. He was ruthless against any opposition—he censored or took control of newspapers and broadcasting companies, created a secret police force (the Gestapo) to root out and crush opposition, deprived Jews of their rights of citizenship, seized the Protestant Church’s finances, and arrested church officials who opposed him. Declaring the Aryan race superior, he prohibited non-Aryans from serving in government.",

He privatized state-owned businesses and encouraged corporate investment, acting aggressively to raise Aryan Germans’ living standards. For example, he set up Volkswagen to make cars affordable and accessible, and he directed the building of the Autobahn. He financed this substantially increased government spending by forcing banks to buy government bonds. The debts that were produced were paid back by the earnings of companies and the central bank (the Reichsbank) monetizing debt. These fiscal policies by and large worked well in achieving Hitler’s goals. This is another example of how borrowing in one’s own currency and increasing one’s own debt and deficits can be highly productive if the money borrowed is put into investments that raise productivity and produce more than enough cash flow to service the debt. Even if it doesn’t cover 100 percent of the debt service, it can be very cost-effective in achieving the economic goals of the country.",

Japan was especially vulnerable to the depression because, as an island nation without adequate natural resources, it relied on exports for income to import necessities. When its exports fell by around 50 percent between 1929 and 1931, Japan was economically devastated. In 1931, Japan went broke—i.e., it was forced to draw down its gold reserves, abandon the gold standard, and float its currency, which depreciated it so greatly that Japan ran out of buying power. These terrible conditions and large wealth gaps led to fighting between the left and the right. By 1932, there was a massive upsurge in right-wing nationalism and militarism, in the hope that order and economic stability could be forcibly restored. Japan set out to get the natural resources (e.g., oil, iron, coal, and rubber) and human resources (i.e., slave labor) it needed by seizing them from other countries, invading Manchuria in 1931 and spreading out through China and Asia. As with Germany, it could be argued that Japan’s path of military aggression to get needed resources was more cost-effective than relying on classic trading and economic practices. In 1934, there was severe famine in parts of Japan, causing even more political turbulence and reinforcing the right-wing, militaristic, nationalistic, and expansionistic movement.",

At the same time, the depression created weak demand, which led to a collapse of US imports and other countries’ sales to the US. As incomes weakened, demand fell and more credit problems occurred in a self-reinforcing downward economic spiral. The US responded by turning protectionist to safeguard jobs, raising tariffs via the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, which further depressed economic conditions in other countries.",

Roosevelt’s March 1933 actions. In Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office, he created several massive government spending programs that were paid for by big tax increases and big budget deficits financed by debt that the Federal Reserve monetized. He instituted jobs programs, unemployment insurance, Social Security supports, and labor- and union friendly programs. After his 1935 tax bill, then popularly called the “Soak the Rich Tax,” the top marginal income tax rate for individuals rose to 75 percent (versus as low as 25 percent in 1930). By 1941, the top personal tax rate was 81 percent, and the top corporate tax rate was 31 percent, having started at 12 percent in 1930. Roosevelt also imposed a number of other taxes. Despite all of these taxes and the pickup in the economy that helped raise tax revenue, budget deficits increased from around 1 percent of GDP to about 4 percent of GDP because the spending increases were so large. From 1933 until the end of 1936 the stock market returned over 200 percent, and the economy grew at a blistering average real rate of about 9 percent.",

When done peacefully these are achieved through large tax increases on the rich and big increases in the supply of money that devalue debtors’ claims, and when done violently they are achieved by forced asset confiscations. In the US and the UK, while there were redistributions of wealth and political power, capitalism and democracy were maintained. In Germany, Japan, Italy, and Spain they were not.",

As is also typical, before all-out wars are declared there is about a decade of economic, technological, geopolitical, and capital wars, during which the conflicting powers intimidate each other, testing the limits of each other’s power. While 1939 and 1941 are known as the official starts of the wars in Europe and the Pacific, the conflicts really began about 10 years before that. In addition to the economically motivated conflicts within countries and the political shifts that arose from them, all of these countries faced increased external economic conflicts as they fought for greater shares of a shrinking economic pie. Because power, and not law, rules international relations, Germany and Japan became more expansionist and increasingly began to test the UK, the US, and France in the competition over resources and influence over territories.",

Earlier in 1940, Secretary of War Henry Stimson had initiated aggressive economic sanctions against Japan, culminating in the Export Control Act of 1940. In mid-1940, the US moved the US Pacific Fleet to Hawaii. In October, the US ramped up the embargo, restricting “all iron and steel to destinations other than Britain and nations of the Western Hemisphere.” The plan was to cut Japan off from resources in order to force them to retreat from most of the areas they had taken over.",

Helping the Allies was good for the US both geopolitically and economically because it made a lot of money selling weapons, food, and other items to these soon-to-be-allied countries who were struggling to maintain production while waging war. But its motivations weren’t entirely mercenary. Great Britain was running out of money (i.e., gold), so the US allowed them to postpone payment until after the war (in some cases waiving payment entirely). Although not an outright declaration of war, Lend-Lease effectively ended the United States’ neutrality.",

In July and August 1941, Roosevelt responded by freezing all Japanese assets in the United States, closing the Panama Canal to Japanese ships, and embargoing oil and gas exports to Japan. This cut off three-fourths of Japan’s trade and 80 percent of its oil. Japan calculated that it would run out of oil in two years. This put Japan in the position of having to choose between backing down or attacking the US.",

They also believed that they had a greater willingness to endure and die for their country, which is a big driver of which side wins. * In war one’s ability to withstand pain is even more important than one’s ability to inflict pain.",

For example, German equities outperformed at the beginning of World War II as Germany captured territory and established military dominance, while they underperformed after Allied powers like the US and the UK turned the tide of the war. After the 1942 Battle of Midway, Allied equities rallied almost continuously until the end of the war, while Axis equities were flat or down. As shown, both the German and Japanese stock markets were closed at the end of the war, didn’t reopen for around five years, and were virtually wiped out when they did, while US stocks were extremely strong.",

French President Emmanuel Macron echoed Merz’s assessment and said that Europe’s old security structures tied to the previous world order don't exist and that Europe must prepare for war. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that we are in a “new geopolitics era” because the “old world” is gone.\nIn my parlance, we are in the Stage 6 part of the Big Cycle in which there is great disorder arising from being in a period in which there are no rules, might is right, and there is a clash of great powers. How Stage 6 works is explained in detail in Chapter 6, “The Big Cycle of External Order and Disorder,” in my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order. While I previously shared a lengthy set of excerpts from Chapter 5 (\"The Big Cycle of Internal Order and Disorder\"), so you could see how what is going on with the United States tracks the classic cycle explained in that chapter, I am including all of Chapter 6 here for your review.  Given the now nearly universal agreement that the post-1945 world order has broken down and that we are entering a new world order, I think it would be worth your time to read.\nChapter 6: The Big Cycle of External Order and Disorder\nRelationships between people and the orders that govern them work in basically the same ways, whether they are internal or external, and they blend together. In fact, it wasn’t long ago that there were no distinctions between internal and external orders because there were no clearly defined and mutually recognized boundaries between countries. For that reason, the six-stage cycle of going between order and disorder that I described in the last chapter about what happens within countries works the same way between countries, with one big exception: international relations are driven much more by raw power dynamics. That is because all governance systems require effective and agreed-upon 1) laws and law-making abilities, 2) law enforcement capabilities (e.g., police), 3) ways of adjudicating (e.g., judges), and 4) clear and specified consequences that both suit crimes and are enforced (e.g., fines and incarcerations), and those things either don’t exist or are not as effective in guiding relations between countries as they are in guiding relations within them.\nWhile attempts have been made to make the external order more rule-abiding (e.g., via the League of Nations and the United Nations), by and large they have failed because these organizations have not had more wealth and power than the most powerful countries. When individual countries have more power than the collectives of countries, the more powerful individual countries rule. For example, if the US, China, or other countries have more power than the United Nations, then the US, China, or other countries will determine how things go rather than the United Nations. That is because power prevails, and wealth and power among equals is rarely given up without a fight.\nWhen powerful countries have disputes, they don’t get their lawyers to plead their cases to judges. Instead, they threaten each other and either reach agreements or fight. The international order follows the law of the jungle much more than it follows international law.\nThere are five major kinds of fights between countries: trade/economic wars, technology wars, capital wars, geopolitical wars, and military wars. Let’s begin by briefly defining them.\n1. Trade/economic wars: Conflicts over tariffs, import/export restrictions, and other ways of damaging a rival economically\n2. Technology wars: Conflicts over which technologies are shared and which are held as protected aspects of national security\n3. Geopolitical wars: Conflicts over territory and alliances that are resolved through negotiations and explicit or implicit commitments, not fighting\n4. Capital wars: Conflicts imposed through financial tools such as sanctions (e.g., cutting off money and credit by punishing institutions and governments that offer it) and limiting foreign access to capital markets\n5. Military wars: Conflicts that involve actual shooting and the deployment of military forces\nMost fights between nations fall under one or more of those categories (cyber warfare, for example, has a role in all of them). They are over wealth and power and the ideologies pertaining to them.\nWhile most of these types of wars don’t involve shooting and killing, they all are power struggles. In most cases, the first four kinds of war will evolve over time as intense competitions between rival nations until a military war begins. These struggles and wars, whether or not they involve shooting and killing, are exertions of power of one side over the other. They can be all-out or contained, depending on how important the issue is and what the relative powers of the opponents are. But once a military war begins, all four of the other dimensions will be weaponized to the greatest extent possible.\nAs discussed in the last several chapters, all of the factors that drive internal and external cycles tend to improve and worsen together. When things get bad, there are more things to argue over, which leads to greater inclinations to fight. That’s human nature, and it is why we have the Big Cycle, which oscillates between good times and bad ones.\nAll-out wars typically occur when existential issues (ones that are so essential to the country’s existence that people are willing to fight and die for them) are at stake and they cannot be resolved by peaceful means. The wars that result from them make it clear which side gets its way and has supremacy in subsequent matters. That clarity over who sets the rules then becomes the basis of a new international order.\nThe following chart shows the cycles of internal and external peace and conflict in Europe going back to 1500 as reflected in the deaths they caused. As you can see, there were three big cycles of rising and declining conflict, averaging about 150 years each. Though big civil and external wars last only a short time, they are typically the culmination of the longstanding conflicts that led up to them.\nWhile World Wars I and II were separately driven by the classic cycle, they were also interrelated.\n \nAs you can see, each cycle consisted of a relatively long period of peace and prosperity (e.g., the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution) that sowed the seeds for terrible and violent external wars (e.g., the Thirty Years’ War, the Napoleonic Wars, and the two World Wars). Both the upswings (the periods of peace and prosperity) and the downswings (the periods of depression and war) affected the whole world. Not all countries prosper when the leading powers do because countries gain at the expense of others. For example, the decline of China from around 1840 to 1949, known as the “Century of Humiliation,” came about because the Western powers and Japan exploited China.\nAs you read on, keep in mind that * the two things about war that one can be most confident in are 1) that it won’t go as planned and 2) that it will be far worse than imagined. It is for those reasons that so many of the principles that follow are about ways to avoid shooting wars. Still, whether they are fought for good reasons or bad, shooting wars happen. To be clear, while I believe most are tragic and fought for nonsensical reasons, some are worth fighting because the consequences of not fighting them (e.g., the loss of freedom) would be intolerable.\nTHE TIMELESS AND UNIVERSAL FORCES THAT PRODUCE CHANGES TO THE EXTERNAL ORDER\nAs I explained in Chapter 2, after self-interest and self-survival, the quest for wealth and power is what most motivates individuals, families, companies, states, and countries. Because wealth equals power in terms of the ability to build military strength, control trade, and influence other nations,  domestic and military strength go hand in hand. It takes money to buy guns (military power) and it takes money to buy butter (domestic social spending needs). When a country fails to provide adequate amounts of either, it becomes vulnerable to domestic and foreign opposition. From my study of Chinese dynasties and European empires, I’ve learned that  the financial strength to outspend one’s rivals is one of the most important strengths a country can have. That is how the United States beat the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Spend enough money in the right ways, and you don’t have to have a shooting war. Long-term success depends on sustaining both the “guns” and the “butter” without producing the excesses that lead to their declines. In other words, a country must be strong enough financially to give its people both a good living standard and protection from outside enemies. The really successful countries have been able to do that for 200 to 300 years. None has been able to do it forever.\nConflict arises when the dominant power begins to weaken or an emerging power begins to approach it in strength—or both. * The greatest risk of military war is when both parties have 1) military powers that are roughly comparable and 2) irreconcilable and existential differences. As of this writing, the most potentially explosive conflict is that between the United States and China over Taiwan.\nThe choice that opposing countries face—either fighting or backing down—is very hard to make. Both are costly—fighting in terms of lives and money, and backing down in terms of the loss of status, since it shows weakness, which leads to reduced support. When two competing entities each have the power to destroy the other, both must have extremely high trust that they won’t be unacceptably harmed or killed by the other. Managing the prisoner’s dilemma well, however, is extremely rare.\nWhile there are no rules in international relations other than those the most powerful impose on themselves, some approaches produce better outcomes than others. Specifically, those that are more likely to lead to win-win outcomes are better than those that lead to lose-lose outcomes. Hence this all-important principle: * to get more win-win outcomes one needs to negotiate with consideration given to what is most important to the other party and to oneself and know how to trade them.\nSkilled collaborations to produce win-win relationships that both increase and divide up wealth and power well are much more rewarding and much less painful than wars that lead to one side subjugating the other. Seeing things through your adversary’s eyes and clearly identifying and communicating your red lines to them (i.e., what cannot be compromised) are the keys to doing this well. * Winning means getting the things that are most important without losing the things that are most important, so wars that cost much more in lives and money than they provide in benefits are stupid. But “stupid” wars still happen all the time for reasons that I will explain.\nIt is far too easy to slip into stupid wars because of a) the prisoner’s dilemma, b) a tit-for-tat escalation process, c) the perceived costs of backing down for the declining power, and d) misunderstandings existing when decision making has to be fast. Rival great powers typically find themselves in the prisoner’s dilemma; they need to have ways of assuring the other that they won’t try to kill them lest the other tries to kill them first. Tit-for-tat escalations are dangerous in that they require each side to escalate or lose what the enemy captured in the last move; it is like a game of chicken—push it too far and there is a head-on crash.\nUntruthful and emotional appeals that rile people up increase the dangers of stupid wars, so it is better for leaders to be truthful and thoughtful in explaining the situation and how they are dealing with it (this is especially essential in a democracy, in which the opinions of the population matter). The worst thing is when leaders are untruthful and emotional in dealing with their populations, and it is worse still when they take over the media.\nBy and large, the tendency to move between win-win relationships and lose-lose relationships happens in a cyclical way. People and empires are more likely to have cooperative relationships during good times and to fight during bad times. When the existing great power is declining in relation to a rising power, it has a natural tendency to want to maintain the status quo or the existing rules, while the rising power wants to change them to be in line with the changing facts on the ground.\nWhile I don’t know about the love part of the saying “all is fair in love and war,” I know the war part is right. As an example, in the American Revolutionary War, when the British lined up in rows for the fight and the American revolutionaries shot at them from behind trees, the British thought that was unfair and complained. The revolutionaries won believing the British were foolish and that the cause of independence and freedom justified changing the rules of war. That’s just how it is.\nThis leads me to one final principle: * have power, respect power, and use power wisely. Having power is good because power will win out over agreements, rules, and laws all the time. When push comes to shove, those who have the power to either enforce their interpretation of the rules and laws or to overturn them will get what they want. It is important to respect power because it’s not smart to fight a war that one is going to lose; it is preferable to negotiate the best settlement possible (that is unless one wants to be a martyr, which is usually for stupid ego reasons rather than for sensible strategic reasons). It is also important to use power wisely. Using power wisely doesn’t necessarily mean forcing others to give you what you want—i.e., bullying them. It includes the recognition that generosity and trust are powerful forces for producing win-win relationships, which are fabulously more rewarding than lose-lose relationships. In other words, it is often the case that using one’s “hard powers” is not the best path and that using one’s “soft powers” is preferable.\nWhen thinking about how to use power wisely, it’s also important to decide when to reach an agreement and when to fight. To do that, a party must imagine how its power will change over time. It is desirable to use one’s power to negotiate an agreement, enforce an agreement, or fight a war when one’s power is greatest. That means that it pays to fight early if one’s relative power is declining and fight later if it’s rising.\nIf one is in a lose-lose relationship, one has to get out of it one way or another, preferably through separation, though possibly through war. To handle one’s power wisely, it’s usually best not to show it because it will usually lead others to feel threatened and build their own threatening powers, which will lead to a mutual escalation that threatens both. Power is usually best handled like a hidden knife that can be brought out in the event of a fight. But there are times when showing one’s power and threatening to use it are most effective for improving one’s negotiating position and preventing a fight. Knowing what matters most and least to the other party, especially what they will and won’t fight for, allows you to work your way toward an equilibrium that both parties consider a fair resolution of a dispute.\nThough it is generally desirable to have power, it is also desirable to not have power that one doesn’t need. That is because maintaining power consumes resources, most importantly your time and your money. Also, with power comes the burden of responsibilities. I have often been struck by how much happier less powerful people can be relative to more powerful people.\nCASE STUDY: WORLD WAR II\nNow that we have covered the dynamics and principles that drive the external order and disorder cycle, which were derived by looking at many cases, I’d like to briefly look at the World War II case because it provides the most recent example of the iconic dynamic of going from peace to war. Though it is only one case, it clearly shows how the confluence of the three big cycles—i.e., the overlapping and interrelated forces of the money and credit cycle, the internal order/disorder cycle, and the external order/disorder cycle—created the conditions for a catastrophic war and laid the groundwork for a new world order. While the stories from this period are very interesting in and of themselves, they are especially important because they provide lessons that help us think about what is happening now and what might be ahead. Most importantly, the United States and China are in an economic war that could conceivably evolve into a military war and comparisons between the 1930s and today provide valuable insights into what might happen and how to avoid a terrible war.\nThe Path to War\nTo help convey the picture of the 1930s, I will run through the geopolitical highlights leading up to the official start of the war in Europe in 1939 and the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. Then I will quickly move through the war and the start of the new world order in 1945, with the US at the peak of its power.\nThe global depression that followed the Great Crash of 1929 led to almost all countries having big internal conflicts over wealth. This caused them to turn to more populist, autocratic, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders and policies. These moves were either to the right or to the left and occurred in varying degrees, according to the countries’ circumstances and the strengths of their democratic or autocratic traditions. In Germany, Japan, Italy, and Spain, extremely bad economic circumstances and less well-established democratic traditions led to extreme internal conflicts and a turn to populist/autocratic leaders of the right (i.e., fascists), just as at different points in time the Soviet Union and China, which also endured extreme circumstances and had no experience with democracy, turned to populist/autocratic leaders of the left (i.e., communists). The US and the UK had much stronger democratic traditions and less severe economic conditions, so they became more populist and autocratic than they had been, but not nearly as much as other nations.\nGermany and Japan\nWhile Germany had previously been saddled with tremendous reparation debts following World War I, by 1929 it was beginning to emerge from under their yoke via the Young Plan, which provided for considerable debt relief and the departure of foreign troops from Germany by 1930. But the global depression hit Germany hard, leading to nearly 25 percent unemployment, massive bankruptcies, and extensive poverty. As is typical, there was a struggle between populists of the left (communists) and populists of the right (fascists). Adolf Hitler, the leading populist/fascist, tapped into the mood of national humiliation to build a nationalistic furor, casting the Treaty of Versailles and the countries that imposed it as the enemy. He created a 25-point nationalistic program and rallied support around it. In response to internal fighting and the desire to restore order, Hitler was appointed chancellor in January 1933, drawing large support for his Nazi Party from industrialists who feared the communists. Two months later, the Nazi Party won the most support and the most seats in the German Parliament (the Reichstag).\nHitler refused to pay any further reparation debts, left the League of Nations, and took autocratic control of Germany in 1934. Holding the dual roles of chancellor and president, he became the country’s supreme leader. In democracies there are always some laws that allow leaders to grab special powers; Hitler seized them all. He invoked Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution to put an end to many civil rights and suppress political opposition from the communists, and forced the passage of the Enabling Act, which allowed him to pass laws without the approval of the Reichstag and the president. He was ruthless against any opposition—he censored or took control of newspapers and broadcasting companies, created a secret police force (the Gestapo) to root out and crush opposition, deprived Jews of their rights of citizenship, seized the Protestant Church’s finances, and arrested church officials who opposed him. Declaring the Aryan race superior, he prohibited non-Aryans from serving in government.\nHitler took that same autocratic/fascist approach to rebuilding Germany’s economy, coupled with big fiscal and monetary stimulation programs. He privatized state-owned businesses and encouraged corporate investment, acting aggressively to raise Aryan Germans’ living standards. For example, he set up Volkswagen to make cars affordable and accessible, and he directed the building of the Autobahn. He financed this substantially increased government spending by forcing banks to buy government bonds. The debts that were produced were paid back by the earnings of companies and the central bank (the Reichsbank) monetizing debt. These fiscal policies by and large worked well in achieving Hitler’s goals. This is another example of how borrowing in one’s own currency and increasing one’s own debt and deficits can be highly productive if the money borrowed is put into investments that raise productivity and produce more than enough cash flow to service the debt. Even if it doesn’t cover 100 percent of the debt service, it can be very cost-effective in achieving the economic goals of the country.\nAs for the economic effects of these policies, when Hitler came to power in 1933 the unemployment rate was 25 percent. By 1938 it was nil. Per capita income increased by 22 percent in the five years after Hitler took power, and real growth averaged over 8 percent per year between 1934 and 1938. As shown in the following charts, German equities rallied nearly 70 percent in a steady trend between 1933 and 1938, until the onset of the hot war.\n \nIn 1935, Hitler began to build the military, making military service compulsory for Aryans. Germany’s military spending increased much faster than any other country because the German economy needed more resources to fuel itself and it intended to use its military power to seize them.\nLike Germany, Japan was also hit exceptionally hard by the depression and became more autocratic in response. Japan was especially vulnerable to the depression because, as an island nation without adequate natural resources, it relied on exports for income to import necessities. When its exports fell by around 50 percent between 1929 and 1931, Japan was economically devastated. In 1931, Japan went broke—i.e., it was forced to draw down its gold reserves, abandon the gold standard, and float its currency, which depreciated it so greatly that Japan ran out of buying power. These terrible conditions and large wealth gaps led to fighting between the left and the right. By 1932, there was a massive upsurge in right-wing nationalism and militarism, in the hope that order and economic stability could be forcibly restored. Japan set out to get the natural resources (e.g., oil, iron, coal, and rubber) and human resources (i.e., slave labor) it needed by seizing them from other countries, invading Manchuria in 1931 and spreading out through China and Asia. As with Germany, it could be argued that Japan’s path of military aggression to get needed resources was more cost-effective than relying on classic trading and economic practices. In 1934, there was severe famine in parts of Japan, causing even more political turbulence and reinforcing the right-wing, militaristic, nationalistic, and expansionistic movement.\nIn the years that followed, Japan’s top-down fascist command economy grew stronger, building a military-industrial complex to protect its existing bases in East Asia and northern China and support its excursions into other countries. As was also the case in Germany, while most Japanese companies remained privately held, their production was controlled by the government.\nWhat is fascism? Consider the following three big choices that a country has to make when selecting its approach to governance:\n1) bottom-up (democratic) or top-down (autocratic) decision making, 2) capitalist or communist (with socialist in the middle) ownership of production, and 3) individualistic (which treats the well-being of the individual with paramount importance) or collectivist (which treats the well-being of the whole with paramount importance). Pick the one from each category that you believe preferred approach. Fascism is autocratic, capitalist, and collectivist.\nFascists believe that top-down autocratic leadership, in which the government directs the production of privately held companies such that individual gratification is subordinated to national success, is the best way to make the country and its people wealthier and more powerful.\nThe US and the Allies\nIn the US, debt problems became ruinous for American banks after 1929, which curtailed their lending around the world, hurting international borrowers. At the same time, the depression created weak demand, which led to a collapse of US imports and other countries’ sales to the US. As incomes weakened, demand fell and more credit problems occurred in a self-reinforcing downward economic spiral. The US responded by turning protectionist to safeguard jobs, raising tariffs via the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, which further depressed economic conditions in other countries.\n* Raising tariffs to protect domestic businesses and jobs during bad economic times is common, but it leads to reduced efficiency because production does not occur where it can be done most efficiently. Ultimately, tariffs contribute to greater global economic weakness, as tariff wars cause the countries that impose them to lose exports. Tariffs do, however, benefit the entities that are protected by them, and they can create political support for the leaders who impose them.\nThe Soviet Union had yet to recover from its devastating 1917–22 revolution and civil war, a lost war to Germany, a costly war with Poland, and a famine in 1921, and it was wracked by political purges and economic hardships throughout the 1930s. China also suffered from civil war, poverty, and a famine in 1928–30. So, when things worsened in 1930 and tariffs began, bad conditions became desperate conditions in those countries.\nTo make matters worse, there were droughts in the US and in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. * Harmful acts of nature (e.g., droughts, floods, and plagues) often cause periods of great economic hardship that when combined with other adverse conditions lead to periods of great conflict. In combination with extreme government policies, millions died in the USSR. At the same time, internal political fighting and fears of Nazi Germany led to purges of hundreds of thousands of people who were accused of spying and shot without trials.\n* Deflationary depressions are debt crises caused by there not being enough money in the hands of debtors to service their debts. They inevitably lead to the printing of money, debt restructurings, and government spending programs that increase the supply of, and reduce the value of, money and credit. The only question is how long it takes for government officials to make this move.\nIn the case of the US, it took three and a half years from the crash in October 1929 until President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s March 1933 actions. In Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office, he created several massive government spending programs that were paid for by big tax increases and big budget deficits financed by debt that the Federal Reserve monetized. He instituted jobs programs, unemployment insurance, Social Security supports, and labor- and union friendly programs. After his 1935 tax bill, then popularly called the “Soak the Rich Tax,” the top marginal income tax rate for individuals rose to 75 percent (versus as low as 25 percent in 1930). By 1941, the top personal tax rate was 81 percent, and the top corporate tax rate was 31 percent, having started at 12 percent in 1930. Roosevelt also imposed a number of other taxes. Despite all of these taxes and the pickup in the economy that helped raise tax revenue, budget deficits increased from around 1 percent of GDP to about 4 percent of GDP because the spending increases were so large. From 1933 until the end of 1936 the stock market returned over 200 percent, and the economy grew at a blistering average real rate of about 9 percent.\nIn 1936, the Federal Reserve tightened money and credit to fight inflation and slow an overheating economy, which caused the fragile US economy to fall back into recession and the other major economies to weaken with it, further raising tensions within and between countries.\nMeanwhile in Europe, the conflict in Spain between the populists of the left (the communists) and the populists of the right (the fascists) flared into the brutal Spanish Civil War. Right-wing Franco, with the support of Hitler, succeeded in purging left-wing opposition in Spain.\n* During periods of severe economic distress and large wealth gaps, there are typically revolutionarily large redistributions of wealth. When done peacefully these are achieved through large tax increases on the rich and big increases in the supply of money that devalue debtors’ claims, and when done violently they are achieved by forced asset confiscations. In the US and the UK, while there were redistributions of wealth and political power, capitalism and democracy were maintained. In Germany, Japan, Italy, and Spain they were not.\n* Before there is a shooting war there is usually an economic war. As is also typical, before all-out wars are declared there is about a decade of economic, technological, geopolitical, and capital wars, during which the conflicting powers intimidate each other, testing the limits of each other’s power. While 1939 and 1941 are known as the official starts of the wars in Europe and the Pacific, the conflicts really began about 10 years before that. In addition to the economically motivated conflicts within countries and the political shifts that arose from them, all of these countries faced increased external economic conflicts as they fought for greater shares of a shrinking economic pie. Because power, and not law, rules international relations, Germany and Japan became more expansionist and increasingly began to test the UK, the US, and France in the competition over resources and influence over territories.\nBefore going on to describe the hot war, I want to elaborate on the common tactics used when economic and capital tools are weaponized.\nThey have been and still are:\n1. Asset freezes/seizures: Preventing an enemy/rival from using or selling foreign assets they rely on. These measures can range from asset freezes for targeted groups in a country (e.g., the current US sanctions of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard or the initial US asset freeze against Japan in World War II) to more severe measures like unilateral debt repudiation or outright seizures of a country’s assets (e.g., some top US policy makers have been talking about not paying our debts to China).\n2. Blocking capital markets access: Preventing a country from accessing their own or another country’s capital markets (e.g., in 1887 Germany banned the purchase of Russian securities and debt to impede Russia’s military buildup; the US is now threatening to do this to China).\n3. Embargoes/blockades: Blocking trade in goods and/or services in one’s own country and in some cases with neutral third parties for the purpose of weakening the targeted country or preventing it from getting essential items (e.g., the US’s oil embargo on Japan and cutting off its ships’ access to the Panama Canal in World War II) or blocking exports from the targeted country to other countries, thus cutting off their income (e.g., France’s blockade of the UK in the Napoleonic Wars).\nIf you’re interested in seeing how these tactics have been applied from 1600 until now, they are available at economicprinciples.org.\nTHE HOT WAR BEGINS\nIn November 1937, Hitler secretly met with his top officials to announce his plans for German expansion to gain resources and bring together the Aryan race. Then he put them into action, first annexing Austria and then seizing a part of what was then Czechoslovakia that contained oil resources. Europe and the US watched warily, not wanting to get drawn into another war so soon after the devastation of World War I.\nAs with all wars, the unknowns were far greater than the knowns because a) rival powers go into wars only when their powers are roughly comparable (otherwise it would be stupidly suicidal for the obviously weaker power) and b) there are way too many possible actions and reactions to anticipate. The only thing that is known at the outset of a hot war is that it will probably be extremely painful and possibly ruinous. As a result, smart leaders typically go into them only if the other side has pushed them into a position of either fighting or losing by backing down. For the Allies, that moment came on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland.\nGermany looked unstoppable; in short order it captured Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, and strengthened its alliances with Japan and Italy, which had common enemies and were ideologically aligned. By seizing territory rapidly (e.g., oil-rich Romania), Hitler’s army was able to conserve its existing oil resources and gain new ones quickly. The thirst for, and acquisition of, natural resources remained a major driver of the Nazi war machine as it pushed its campaigns into Russia and the Middle East. War with the Soviets was inevitable; the only question was when. Although Germany and the USSR had signed a non-aggression pact, Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, which put Germany in an extremely costly war on two fronts.\nIn the Pacific in 1937, Japan expanded its occupation of China, brutally taking control of Shanghai and Nanking, killing an estimated 200,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants in the capture of Nanking alone. While the US remained isolationist, it did provide Chiang Kai-shek’s government with fighter planes and pilots to counter the Japanese, putting a toe in the war. Conflicts between the US and Japan began to flare. A Japanese soldier struck the US consul, John Moore Allison, in the face in Nanking and Japanese fighter planes sank a US gunship.\nIn November 1940, Roosevelt won re-election after campaigning on the promise to keep the US out of the war, even though the US was already taking economic actions to protect its interests, especially in the Pacific, using economic supports to help countries it sympathized with and economic sanctions against those it did not. Earlier in 1940, Secretary of War Henry Stimson had initiated aggressive economic sanctions against Japan, culminating in the Export Control Act of 1940. In mid-1940, the US moved the US Pacific Fleet to Hawaii. In October, the US ramped up the embargo, restricting “all iron and steel to destinations other than Britain and nations of the Western Hemisphere.” The plan was to cut Japan off from resources in order to force them to retreat from most of the areas they had taken over.\nIn March 1941, Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed the US to lend or lease war supplies to the nations it deemed to be acting in ways that were “vital to the defense of the United States,” which included Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. Helping the Allies was good for the US both geopolitically and economically because it made a lot of money selling weapons, food, and other items to these soon-to-be-allied countries who were struggling to maintain production while waging war. But its motivations weren’t entirely mercenary. Great Britain was running out of money (i.e., gold), so the US allowed them to postpone payment until after the war (in some cases waiving payment entirely). Although not an outright declaration of war, Lend-Lease effectively ended the United States’ neutrality.\n* When countries are weak, opposing countries take advantage of their weaknesses to obtain gains. France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain all had colonies in Asia. Overstretched by the fighting in Europe, they were unable to defend them against the Japanese. Starting in September 1940, Japan invaded several colonies in Southeast Asia, beginning with French Indochina, adding what it called the Southern Resource Zone to its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In 1941, Japan seized oil reserves in the Dutch East Indies.\nThis Japanese territorial expansion was a threat to the US’s own Pacific ambitions. In July and August 1941, Roosevelt responded by freezing all Japanese assets in the United States, closing the Panama Canal to Japanese ships, and embargoing oil and gas exports to Japan. This cut off three-fourths of Japan’s trade and 80 percent of its oil. Japan calculated that it would run out of oil in two years. This put Japan in the position of having to choose between backing down or attacking the US.\nOn December 7 and 8, 1941, Japan launched coordinated attacks on US military forces at Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines. This marked the beginning of the declared war in the Pacific, which brought the US into the war in Europe too. While Japan didn’t have a widely recognized plan to win the war, the most optimistic Japanese leaders believed that the US would lose because it was fighting a war on two fronts and because its individualistic/capitalist political system was inferior to Japan’s and Germany’s authoritarian/fascist systems with their command military-industrial complexes. They also believed that they had a greater willingness to endure and die for their country, which is a big driver of which side wins. * In war one’s ability to withstand pain is even more important than one’s ability to inflict pain.\nWARTIME ECONOMIC POLICIES\nJust as it is worth noting what classic economic war tactics are, it is also worth noting what classic wartime economic policies are within countries. These include government controls on just about everything as the country shifts its resources from profit making to war making—e.g., the government determines a) what items are allowed to be produced, b) what items can be bought and sold in what amounts (rationing), c) what items can be imported and exported, d) prices, wages, and profits, e) access to one’s own financial assets, and f) the ability to move one’s own money out of the country. Because wars are expensive, classically the government g) issues lots of debt that is monetized, h) relies on non-credit money such as gold for international transactions because its credit is not accepted, i) governs more autocratically, j) imposes various types of economic sanctions on enemies, including cutting off their access to capital, and k) experiences enemies imposing these sanctions on them.\nWhen the US entered the European and Pacific wars after the attack on Pearl Harbor, classic wartime economic policies were put in place in most countries by leaders whose more autocratic approaches were broadly supported by their populations. The following table shows those economic controls in each of the major countries.\n \nThe market movements during the hot war years were heavily affected by both government controls and how countries did in battles as the odds of winning and losing changed. The next table shows the controls over markets and capital flows that were put in place by the major countries during the war years.\n \nStock market closures were common in a number of countries, leaving investors in stocks stuck without access to their capital. I should also note that money and credit were not commonly accepted between non-allied countries during the war because of a justifiable wariness about whether the currency would have any value. As noted earlier, gold—or, in some cases, silver or barter—is the coin of the realm during wars. At such times, prices and capital flows are typically controlled, so it is difficult to say what the real prices of many things are.\nBecause losing wars typically leads to a total wipeout of wealth and power, movements of those stock markets that remained open in the war years were largely driven by how countries did in key battles as these results shifted the probability of victory or defeat for each side. For example, German equities outperformed at the beginning of World War II as Germany captured territory and established military dominance, while they underperformed after Allied powers like the US and the UK turned the tide of the war. After the 1942 Battle of Midway, Allied equities rallied almost continuously until the end of the war, while Axis equities were flat or down. As shown, both the German and Japanese stock markets were closed at the end of the war, didn’t reopen for around five years, and were virtually wiped out when they did, while US stocks were extremely strong.\n \nProtecting one’s wealth in times of war is difficult, as normal economic activities are curtailed, traditionally safe investments are not safe, capital mobility is limited, and high taxes are imposed when people and countries are fighting for their survival. Protecting the wealth of those who have it is not a priority relative to the need to redistribute wealth to get it to where it is needed most. As for investing, sell out of all debt and buy gold because wars are financed by borrowing and printing money, which devalues debt and money, and because there is a justifiable reluctance to accept credit.\nCONCLUSION\nEvery world power has its time in the sun, thanks to the uniqueness of their circumstances and the nature of their character and culture (e.g., they have the essential elements of a strong work ethic, smarts, discipline, education, etc.), but they all eventually decline. Some do so more gracefully than others, with less trauma, but they nevertheless decline. Traumatic declines can lead to some of the worst periods in history, when big fights over wealth and power prove extremely costly both economically and in human lives.\nStill, the cycle needn’t transpire this way if countries in their rich and powerful stages stay productive, earn more than they spend, make the system work well for most of their populations, and figure out ways of creating and sustaining win-win relationships with their most significant rivals. A number of empires and dynasties have sustained themselves for hundreds of years, and the United States, at 245 years old, has proven itself to be one of the longest-lasting.",

Ray Dalio studied over 500 years of history and found that all major nations go through a predictable 6-stage cycle: 1.Rise of a New Order – when unity, hard work, productivity, and strong education lead the way. 2.Prosperity – when wealth grows and the world respects the country more. 3.Debt Bubble – when borrowing gets out of control and people get comfortable with it. 4.Internal Conflict – political fights, inequality, social anger. 5.External Conflict – rival countries challenge the leading nation. 6.Breakdown \u0026 Reboot – the old system falls apart, and a new one starts. Dalio thinks the world is nearing the end of the American-led post-WWII cycle.\n\nWhere the U.S. Is in the Cycle? Dalio says the U.S. is in Stage 4, moving into Stage 5, which he calls the Late Decline, with big issues like: record national debt, extreme political polarization, dropping education and productivity, weaker global influence, a rising rival like China, and stress on the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Historically, this signals the late-stage decline of past empires.\n\nThe Big Warning: Dalio’s message is that many people are surprised by world events because they don’t understand that the global system is breaking down. All the chaos—conflict, inflation, anger, political fights, instability, shifting alliances—is normal for late-cycle times. The system is acting just like past superpowers did before they had to reset.\n\nThe 3 Possible Future Scenarios Dalio sees are:\n1. Disorderly Decline (higher risk) – debt crisis, currency problems, internal and geopolitical conflicts, loss of U.S. dominance.\n2. Managed Decline (middle chance) – controlled reforms, slow changes, peaceful sharing of power, a multipolar world.\n3. Renewal/Rebirth (lower chance) – national unity, tough reforms, innovation booms, stable leadership. This last one needs rare political cooperation.\n\nKey Indicators to Watch Dalio recommends keeping an eye on these 7 early warning signs:\n- Inflation\n- Debt crisis risk\n- U.S.–China tensions\n- Dollar strength\n- Social unrest\n- Technological breakthroughs\n- Global military incidents\nChanges in these indicators can tell you if the U.S. is heading downward or stabilizing.\n\nHow Individuals Can Protect Themselves Dalio suggests simple steps for everyday people during turbulent times: diversify your investments worldwide—don’t rely on just one country. Own real assets like gold, real estate, or commodities—they tend to survive monetary resets. Avoid too much personal debt, especially during inflation. Develop high-value skills so you stay employable regardless of how things change. Build a strong network or community because social support becomes crucial when stability is shaky.\n\nThe Big Picture (One Sentence) Dalio believes the U.S.-led world order is nearing the end of its natural cycle, showing all the same signs past empires did before restructuring—so it’s important to prepare, diversify, and stay flexible."

But in many regions, it never truly existed"

It is the contempt of the spider for the butterfly: the predator mocking the beauty of a creature whose sole crime is to be visible, useful, and free. In October 2013, Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender operating a transnational blackmail network from his private island, sat down at his computer in the U.S. Virgin Islands and composed an email to Bill Gates about Ray Dalio's economic model (EFTA00974279). \n \nHe called it \"a 6th grader's science fair project.\" He called Dalio \"the emperor with no clothes.\" He ran a psychopath experiment, showing Dalio's video to twelve people, six with attribution and six without, to prove that human beings evaluate ideas based on authority rather than merit. The irony, of course, is that Epstein's entire existence was built on that exact principle: authority without merit, influence without legitimacy, power without accountability (EFTA00975566).\n \nThirteen years later, the emperor is not only clothed but vindicated. On February 14, 2026, at the 62nd Munich Security Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered what may be the most consequential speech by an American diplomat since Reagan's Westminster Address in 1982. Standing in the Hotel Bayerischer Hof, the son of Cuban exiles told the assembled leaders of the Western world that their civilization was worth defending, that their heritage demanded pride rather than apology, and that the postwar order they had built was no longer functioning. \"Armies do not fight for abstractions,\" Rubio declared. \"Armies fight for a people; armies fight for a nation. Armies fight for a way of life.\"\nOn the very same day, at the very same conference, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the recently released Epstein files \"horrifying\" and demanded total transparency, even as photographs of her husband in a pool with Ghislaine Maxwell circulated through the corridors of the Bayerischer Hof.\nAnd somewhere between these two events, in the uncomfortable silence where history adjudicates between prophets and predators, stands the vindication of Ray Dalio: the man Epstein despised, the thinker Epstein mocked, and the analyst whose \"simplistic\" model of the world order's collapse turned out to be exactly, devastatingly, correct.\nThis is the story of all three.\nI. The Speech That Sounded Like a President\nIt must be said plainly: Marco Rubio's address in Munich on February 14, 2026, was not the speech of a Secretary of State. It was the speech of a president. Watch it here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlL3pwlO2rE)\nNot in the sense of overreach or ambition, but in the sense of vision. Where Vice President JD Vance had come to the same stage a year earlier with a scalpel, dissecting European hypocrisy on free speech and censorship with surgical precision, Rubio arrived with something different: a civilizational framework. Vance diagnosed the disease. Rubio offered the cure.\n\"We gather here today as members of a historic alliance, an alliance that saved and changed the world,\" Rubio began, invoking the conference's origins in 1963, when the Berlin Wall was fresh and the Cuban Missile Crisis had nearly ended everything. He traced the arc from that moment to the present with a historian's care and an orator's instinct, calling America \"a child of Europe,\" bound to the continent by \"Christian faith, culture, heritage, language, ancestry, and the sacrifices our forefathers made together for the common civilization to which we have fallen heir.\"\nThe phrase \"Western civilization\" appeared in Rubio's speech as often as the word \"democracy.\" This was not accidental. It was doctrinal. The Trump administration, through Vance's provocation and Rubio's persuasion, was articulating something the postwar consensus had systematically avoided: the proposition that the West is not merely a set of institutional arrangements or trade agreements, but a civilization with spiritual roots, cultural coherence, and a right to survive.\n\"We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline,\" Rubio said.\nThe standing ovation that followed was not the polite applause of diplomats enduring an ally's lecture. It was relief. Even the EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, acknowledged the reassurance, noting the stark contrast with Vance's more \"pugnacious\" tone of the previous year. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who hours earlier had declared that the postwar rules-based order \"no longer exists,\" seemed to exhale. Here was an American who understood that the house was burning but still wanted to rebuild it, together, with the same bricks.\nJoel Rosenberg, the bestselling author, called it \"one of the most important, well argued, and powerful addresses I've ever heard a Secretary of State deliver.\" The Foundation for Defense of Democracies CEO Mark Dubowitz said it was \"Reaganesque in vision, Churchillian in resolve.\" Even Gavin Newsom, prospective Democratic presidential candidate, conceded that if Rubio was referencing \"the best of Roman Republic and Greek democracy, popular sovereignty and the rule of law,\" then he could align with the remarks.\nBut the significance of Rubio's speech lies not merely in its rhetoric. It lies in what it confirmed: the world order as constructed after 1945 is over. Not reforming. Not declining. Over. And the man who predicted this with mathematical precision, the man Jeffrey Epstein called a fool, is Ray Dalio.\nII. The Prophet Epstein Despised\nRay Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates from his two-bedroom apartment in 1975. By 2013, the firm managed approximately $160 billion, making it the largest hedge fund on the planet. That year, Dalio produced a 30-minute animated video titled \"How the Economic Machine Works,\" a distillation of his understanding of credit cycles, deleveraging, and the recurring patterns that have governed economies for centuries.\nHe sent it personally to Bill Gates on October 16, 2013. The accompanying note was characteristically modest: \"I know that you are terribly busy with very important matters. Nonetheless, I would appreciate you taking 30 minutes to view the video. Besides possibly helping me, I believe that it might help you. I distilled everything I have to say about economics into this 30 minutes.\"\nGates watched it. He liked it enough to promote it in a tweet. And then he did something that, in retrospect, reveals one of the most disturbing intellectual dependencies of the 21st century: he forwarded it to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\"Ray did a strong job on this video, which I promoted in a tweet,\" Gates wrote to Epstein on October 30, 2013. \"I will be interested to get your reaction to it if you have a chance to look at it\" (Document EFTA00974279).\nRemember: at this point, Epstein was already a convicted sex offender. He had served time for soliciting prostitution from a minor. He was operating from his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. And Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, was sending him intellectual homework and asking for his opinion.\nEpstein's response, composed in the early hours of October 31, 2013, is one of the most revealing documents in the entire Epstein archive. It merits careful reading, because what it reveals is not merely arrogance; it is the architecture of a psychopath's self-image.\n\"Ray is a well-meaning person,\" Epstein wrote. \"His funds show great results. He believes himself to be both a critical thinker and a teacher. He is certainly not the former. He stands high above many of his peers, but I believe that is due to the flatness of the landscape around him. The video is just wrong, over-simplified and pedestrian.\"\nEpstein then launched into a critique invoking Poincaré's three-body problem, systems theory, Nazi Germany's hyperinflation, and the distinction between credit creation and credit exchange. He concluded: \"I guess the idea is that if he uses the word 'simple' enough, people will believe it. The emperor has no clothes. Sorry. I will review more tomorrow, or maybe he does have clothes, but they must have been a clown suit when he put this together, or it was to be his 6th grader's science fair project\" (Document EFTA00974279).\nWhat followed was worse. Epstein conducted what can only be described as a psychological experiment. He showed Dalio's video to twelve people, six of whom were told Dalio had produced it, and six who were told it was made by \"a local kid here in the VI.\" The results, he reported to Gates with evident satisfaction, were \"highly skewed\": those who believed Dalio was the author found it interesting, while those who thought a child had made it dismissed it as simplistic (Document EFTA00975566).\nThis experiment was not a scholarship. It was manipulation dressed as intellect, the signature move of a man whose entire career was built on exploiting the gap between perception and reality.\nAnd Gates agreed with him. \"I agree that the model is super simplistic,\" Gates wrote back. Then came the sentence that should haunt him: \"You look at a far more complex model than the one Ray puts forward\" (Document EFTA00694401).\nThe richest man in the world told a convicted pedophile that his economic thinking was more sophisticated than that of the man running the largest hedge fund on Earth. One can almost hear the gears of Epstein's manipulation clicking into place.\nIII. The Network Behind the Contempt\nThe Epstein documents reveal not merely a personal disdain for Dalio but an entire ecosystem of influence in which Dalio was a target, a trophy to be hunted.\nIn October 2011, cognitive scientist Roger Schank asked Epstein a simple question: \"Do you know Ray Dalio?\" Epstein's reply was immediate: \"do not know ray. ghislaine does\" (Document EFTA00922013). Ghislaine Maxwell, the woman now serving twenty years in federal prison for sex trafficking minors, was Epstein's social bridge to the world of high finance. She knew Dalio. Epstein did not.\nIn October 2012, Epstein tried to arrange a dinner bringing Dalio together with Woody Allen and Tim Zagat. He misspelled the name as \"Dailo,\" a detail suggesting he had never interacted with the man directly. Dalio was \"not around.\" He never came (Document EFTA00403182).\nIn November 2012, Epstein outlined to Boris Nikolic, Gates's former science advisor, a grand scheme to create a Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) that would aggregate the charitable giving of the world's wealthiest people under Gates's management, with Epstein as the invisible architect. The target list included \"george lucas, ray dalio, peter lewis\" (Document EFTA00646654). In a moment of devastating candor, Epstein told Nikolic: \"Remember, none are responding to polio. They are only responding to Bill calling.\" The billionaires were not giving to save children from disease. They were giving to have access to Bill Gates.\nBy September 2014, Gates was reporting his entire weekly schedule to Epstein, including meetings with President Obama, events at the Robin Hood Foundation, and dinners where he would pitch the DAF concept. \"Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones and others will be at both events,\" Gates wrote. The strategy was explicitly Epstein's: \"When you are in for Robin Hood, perfect time for you to pitch DAF\" (Document EFTA02386397).\nMeanwhile, the Gates Foundation's own internal documents from a September 2013 event at JPMorgan Chase headquarters recorded \"outreach to Ray Dalio to suggest his participation in polio eradication efforts\" (Document EFTA01103797). Jamie Dimon, Tony Blair, and executives from GSK, Pfizer, and Merck were present. Dalio, so far as the record shows, declined. He seems to have been the one great fish that never swam into Epstein's net.\nThe documents contain no evidence that Ray Dalio ever met Jeffrey Epstein, attended any event at Epstein's residences, or had any direct communication with him. Dalio appears in the Epstein archive as an object of desire, derision, and failed recruitment, never as a participant.\nIV. The World Order Breaks Down, Exactly as Predicted\nIn February 2026, days before the Munich Security Conference, Ray Dalio published an article titled \"It's Official: The World Order Has Broken Down.\" In it, he described the present moment as Stage 6 of his Big Cycle framework: \"a period in which there are no rules, might is right, and there is a clash of great powers.\" At the World Governments Summit in Dubai, Dalio warned that the world was \"on the brink\" of a capital war, noting that Trump's Greenland threats had created reciprocal fears between the United States and European holders of U.S. securities.\n \nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz opened the Munich conference with an even starker assessment: \"This order, as flawed as it has been even in its heyday, no longer exists.\"\nThe conference's own report, titled \"Under Destruction,\" described a world in which \"political forces have gained influence that favour destruction over reform.\" It was, in essence, a diplomatic validation of the thesis Epstein had called a \"6th grader's science fair project.\"\nThe irony is not subtle. It is cosmic.\nIn 2013, Epstein mocked Dalio's model for being \"just wrong, oversimplified and pedestrian.\" He invoked Poincaré and systems theory to argue that the economy is too complex to be understood through simple cycles. He ridiculed Dalio for never using \"the word TAXES.\" He conducted psychological experiments to demonstrate that people evaluate ideas based on the authority of the speaker rather than the quality of the thought.\nAnd every single one of these criticisms missed the point.\nDalio was not claiming that his model captured every variable in the global economy. He was claiming that certain patterns, credit cycles, debt accumulation, the rise and fall of reserve currencies, and the breakdown of domestic and international orders repeat with sufficient regularity that they can be studied, anticipated, and prepared for. He was right. The model that Epstein called a toy car with \"only a gas pedal (credit), an engine (productivity), and transmission (income)\" turned out to describe, with eerie accuracy, the exact world Rubio addressed in Munich.\nConsider the convergence. Dalio's framework predicts that great powers rise and fall through cycles of debt, innovation, military expansion, and eventual overextension. In Munich, Rubio described this arc precisely: the postwar order built by America and Europe, the deindustrialization driven by dogmatic free trade, the hollowing out of Western manufacturing to the benefit of competitors who \"exploit oil and coal and natural gas and anything else, not just to power their economies, but to use as leverage against our own.\"\nDalio's framework predicts that internal disorder accompanies external challenges when wealth gaps widen and institutional trust collapses. In Munich, Rubio warned of \"civilizational erasure\" through unchecked migration and the abandonment of founding values, the same internal fractures Dalio identifies as Stage 5 and Stage 6 dynamics.\nDalio's framework predicts that the existing monetary order will strain under unsustainable debt. The United States sits at $38 trillion in national debt. Rubio did not mention the number, but the entire subtext of his speech, the call for reindustrialization, energy independence, and a \"new Western century,\" is an implicit acknowledgment that the current trajectory is unsustainable.\nThe \"local kid from the Virgin Islands\" whose model Epstein despised had, in fact, built the intellectual framework within which every major leader at the Munich Security Conference was operating. They just called it by different names.\nV. Two Worldviews, Tested by Time\nThere is a theological dimension to this story that deserves articulation.\nJeffrey Epstein operated under a worldview that might be called radical instrumentalism: human beings are tools, relationships are transactions, truth is whatever produces the desired effect, and the only real currency is leverage. His economic criticism of Dalio was not an honest intellectual exercise. It was a performance designed to reinforce his position as Gates's preferred interlocutor, the brilliant outsider whose sophistication made everyone else look pedestrian. The social experiment with the video was not science. It was a demonstration of power: the power to make other people's perceptions serve his narrative.\nRay Dalio operates under a fundamentally different worldview: that reality exists independently of what we want it to be, that patterns recur because human nature recurs, and that the job of the thinker is not to impress but to understand. His \"Principles,\" whatever one thinks of their specific content, are an attempt to create a framework for honest engagement with truth. His model of economic cycles is deliberately simplified because simplicity, when it captures essential dynamics, is a feature, not a bug.\nRubio's Munich speech represents a third worldview, one that is older than either and that both, in their different ways, engage with: the idea that civilizations are organic entities with spiritual foundations, that they can be destroyed by their own internal contradictions, and that their survival depends on whether the people who inherit them still believe they are worth defending.\n\"What exactly are we defending?\" Rubio asked. \"Armies fight for a people; armies fight for a nation. Armies fight for a way of life.\"\nEpstein would have found this laughable. For Epstein, there was nothing to defend but one's own position. The very concept of civilization as a shared inheritance would have struck him as sentimental nonsense, the kind of thing the \"flat landscape\" of lesser minds produces.\nDalio, by contrast, has spent the last decade studying exactly this question. His book \"Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order\" examines the rise and fall of the Dutch, British, and American empires through the lens of debt, innovation, and social cohesion. His conclusion, that the United States is in the late stages of a Big Cycle and that a new order is emerging, is neither optimistic nor pessimistic. It is diagnostic. And it is the diagnosis that every leader in Munich, from Merz to Macron to Rubio, was grappling with, whether they cited Dalio or not.\nVI. The Fish That Never Bit\nThere is something quietly admirable about Ray Dalio's absence from the Epstein web.\nThe documents show that Epstein wanted him. He tried dinner invitations, philanthropic recruitment, intellectual courtship through the Gates channel, and proxy approaches through Ghislaine Maxwell and Roger Schank. He listed Dalio alongside George Lucas and Peter Lewis as targets for the grand DAF scheme. He tracked Dalio's movements, noting when Kissinger received the same video pitch (Document EFTA00975553), monitoring Dalio's appearances at Robin Hood Foundation events, and circulating Bridgewater market reports while privately calling their author a fool.\nAnd yet Dalio never appeared. He never attended an Epstein dinner. He never visited the island. He never entered the orbit. He was the billionaire who said no, or perhaps more precisely, the billionaire who never needed to say anything at all, because the invitation was never accepted at any level.\nThis stands in brutal contrast to Bill Gates, who in the very latest DOJ release, in late January 2026, saw the publication of Epstein's draft emails alleging sordid personal matters, claims Gates has called \"absolutely absurd and completely false.\" It stands in contrast to the photographs of Bill Clinton in a pool with Ghislaine Maxwell that Hillary Clinton, from the Munich conference itself, called \"horrifying\" while demanding transparency. It stands in contrast to the 3 million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos that the Justice Department has now released, a sprawling testament to the gravitational pull of a monster.\nDalio, the man Epstein called an emperor without clothes, turns out to be the one figure in this story who kept his wardrobe intact.\nVII. The Verdict of History\nJeffrey Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, in circumstances that remain, to put it charitably, controversial. His model of the world, such as it was, died with him: a model built on exploitation, blackmail, social manipulation, and the cynical conviction that all human interaction is merely leverage by other means.\nRay Dalio's model, the one Epstein called a clown suit and a science fair project, is today the operating framework for understanding the most consequential geopolitical transition since the end of the Cold War. His prediction that the world order would break down, that great power competition would return, that debt cycles would strain the social fabric, and that the transition between orders would be dangerous and disorderly, is no longer a prediction. It is a description of the present.\nMarco Rubio's speech in Munich was, in a sense, the political answer to Dalio's analytical question. If the old order is collapsing, what do we build in its place? Rubio's answer: a renewed Western civilization, rooted in Christian heritage and cultural confidence, defended by sovereign nations that refuse to be \"polite caretakers of managed decline,\" and animated by a shared conviction that the civilization they inherited is worth fighting for.\nVance cut the wound open in 2025. Rubio applied the medicine in 2026. Together, their Munich speeches constitute the most coherent articulation of American conservative foreign policy since the Reagan Doctrine. And they do so in a world whose contours were mapped, with remarkable accuracy, by the man a dead pedophile once called a fool.\nThe emperor had clothes all along.\nThe man who said he didn't died naked, in a cell, with nothing left but the wreckage of his lies.\nLeonardo Dias is the co-founder of Arvor (@arvor_ia) and host of the Ressonância Cognitiva podcast.

The \"Worst Periods\" in History\n​Dalio refers to the Transition Phases—the volatile moments when a dominant world power (like the Dutch or British Empires in the past, or the U.S. today) begins to decline and a new rival (like China) rises to challenge it.\n\n​The Conflict: These periods are defined by \"big fights over wealth and power.\"\n\n​The Cost: These struggles often lead to Total War (civil or international) and Economic Collapse (hyperinflation or debt crises), which are \"extremely costly both economically and in human lives.\"\n\n​2. The Formula for \"Eternal\" Prosperity\n​The author argues that this cycle of collapse is not inevitable. A nation can stay at the \"Rich and Powerful\" stage for much longer if it follows four specific behaviors:\n​High Productivity: Constantly innovating and staying more competitive than other nations.\n​Fiscal Discipline: \"Earn more than they spend.\" If a country prints too much money to pay off massive debts, its currency eventually collapses.\n​Social Inclusion: \"Make the system work well for most.\" If the wealth gap becomes too extreme, internal conflict (populism or revolution) destroys the country from within.\n​Strategic Diplomacy: Creating \"win-win relationships\" with rivals to avoid the massive costs of a \"Hot War.\"\n\n​3. The United States: A 245-Year Milestone\n​The text highlights that the United States is currently one of the longest-lasting empires in history. At 245+ years old (as of the writing), it has proven remarkably resilient.\n​The Subtext (The Warning): Most empires throughout history lasted roughly 250 years before hitting a major crisis. By mentioning the U.S. age, Dalio is subtly warning that the U.S. is entering the \"danger zone\" where it must fix its internal issues (debt, political polarization, and education) to avoid the typical historical collapse.\n\n​💡 Key Takeaway\n​History repeats itself, but it doesn't have to. If a country stays productive, lives within its means, and maintains social harmony, it can defy the \"natural\" cycle of decline."

Where I disagree is the leap from \"under stress\" to Stage 6 collapse. Your model seems to work backwards,taking centuries of messy history and finding the pattern it's looking for. 2008 could have been Stage 6. COVID could have been. Neither were. The line keeps moving, and I think it's fair to ask how predictive the framework actually is versus how well it explains things after the fact. I'd also push back on the 1930s comparison. The structural conditions you track are real including debt levels, wealth gaps, and polarization, but the differences matter too. The gold standard transmitted deflationary shocks with no relief valve. Today we have floating exchange rates, central bank swap lines, and monetary tools that didn't exist then. More importantly, nuclear weapons didn't exist in the 1930s. That one fact fundamentally changed how great powers interact. They haven't fought each other directly in 80 years and I'd genuinely love to hear how your framework accounts for that, because it's the most important data point in modern international relations and the Big Cycle doesn't seem to have an answer for it. The part I find most worth debating is the \"might is right\" framing. When we tell people the rules don't matter and power is all that counts, we risk not just describing reality but shaping it. That framing can give authoritarian governments exactly the justification they're looking for. You're asking the right questions and I think everyone benefits from that. But when someone with your influence says collapse is inevitable, capital repositions, leaders harden, and people stop believing the order is worth defending. I'd argue that's not just a forecast because it carries other weight."

Sovereign debt expanding everywhere central banks losing credibility and retail still buying dips like its 2021. Neptune shifting into Aries while Saturn restructures everything in Pisces is not a coincidence its a cosmic mirror of the financial reset unfolding\n\nThe principles here are timeless but most traders treat them like philosophy class instead of actual risk management tools. Diversification sounds boring until the concentrated portfolio blows up in your face\n\nWhat I took from studying these frameworks years ago was simple. Position sizing and patience beat conviction every single time. The market doesnt care how smart you think you are it only respects discipline\n\nApply the wisdom or keep learning the hard way.
